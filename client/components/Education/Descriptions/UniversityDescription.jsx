        I focused on logic and ethics topics in philosophy, and social and
        developmental topics in psychology. My university education enriched my
        ability to think analytically and critically, to ask questions that
        clarify, challenge, and deepen my understanding of complex concepts and
        topics.
      </p>

        I also completed papers in mathematics, and complete with A grades
        papers in first year programming and on the MƒÅori world.
