        I practice Nonviolent Communication (NVC) because I found it effectively
        provides emotional relief, transforms conflict into understanding, and
        it's a great problem-solving tool. I've found that when we connect with
        our needs, this enables us to 1) identify relevant goals, and 2) come up
        with more effective strategies.
