        The Heroic Coach program enriches my knowledge of effective working and
        living from scientific and wisdom literature. Most importantly, it
        requires me to cultivate habits that enable me to show up at my best, so
        I can give the world my best. So far, I have created a strong sleep
        routine and an almost daily habit of journaling about what my best self
        looks like in energy, work, and love.
