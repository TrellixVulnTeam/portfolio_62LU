## Reflections
### 30/08/22
#### Obstacles / Difficulties: 
1. My computer died. RIP. Luckily I have someone wonderful in my life who is lending me their computer to work on this portfolio.
2. Tailwind CSS x Flexbox.
3. React useState hook x window.location.pathname. Still to be overcome. I have three sections to my website: education, projects, and about me, which you can access through a navigation bar. I want to embolden the relevant section link on the nav bar if the user is visiting that section.

#### Learnings:
1. Tailwind CSS x Flexbox. I'd neglected styling during my Dev Academy Aotearoa (DAA) journey, focusing on aspects that involved more complexity and problem-solving, so it's only fair that I'd struggled with styling with Tailwind CSS and Flexbox. I'm proud of myself for not banging my head against the wall, having the wisdom to step back, and research and create a mental model of how Flexbox works. I'd already used Tailwind at DAA (I'd already done the mahi and cried the tears), and along with copying the configuration from a DAA group project, this part was easy.
2. Wireframes are useful! During a styling dilemma while I was coding, I went back to my wireframes, which made decision-making easy.
3. My user stories and release plan provide clarity. Especially with what I should be doing at each moment.
4. I've still got it!
